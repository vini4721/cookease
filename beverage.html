                            Strain the chai into cups, discarding the spices and tea leaves. Serve hot and enjoy your aromatic, flavorful masala chai!</p>

                        <p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Water, green tea leaves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, saffron strands, sugar or honey (to taste), slivered almonds, crushed pistachios (optional), rose petals (optional).</p>

                            Add sugar or honey to taste, stirring to dissolve. If you want a richer flavor, you can also add a little more saffron for extra color and fragrance.
                            
                            Strain the kahwa into cups, discarding the tea leaves and spices. Garnish with slivered almonds and crushed pistachios for added crunch, and a few rose petals for an authentic touch (optional).

                        <h2>Thandai</h2>
                        <p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Milk, sugar, water, almonds, cashews, pistachios, melon seeds, fennel seeds, cardamom pods, black peppercorns, rose petals (optional), saffron strands (optional), rose water (optional).</p>
                        <p><strong>Recipe: </strong>To make thandai, start by preparing the paste by soaking 10-12 almonds, 10-12 cashews, 10-12 pistachios, 1 tablespoon melon seeds, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, 4-5 cardamom pods, and 4-5 black peppercorns in water for 3-4 hours, or overnight. After soaking, blend these ingredients into a smooth paste using a little water. In a saucepan, heat 4 cups of milk and add sugar to taste (about 3-4 tablespoons), stirring until the sugar dissolves. Let the milk come to a slight boil, then remove it from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, add the prepared thandai paste to the milk, stir well, and let it sit for about 30 minutes for the flavors to infuse. Optionally, you can add saffron strands or a few drops of rose water for extra flavor. After the milk has infused, strain it through a fine sieve to remove any coarse particles. Pour the strained thandai into glasses, garnish with chopped nuts and rose petals if desired, and serve chilled for a refreshing, spiced drink.</p>
