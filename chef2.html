                <p class="ingredient"><strong>Recipe:</strong>To prepare Aloo Nazakat, begin by scooping medium-sized potatoes and lightly boiling them in salted water until tender yet firm. Drain and cool, then fry them lightly in oil. For the stuffing, mix grated paneer with finely chopped cashew nuts, raisins, green chilies, grated ginger, coriander leaves, a pinch of garam masala, nutmeg powder, and salt. Fill the potatoes with this mixture. Prepare a marinade by whisking hung curd with red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, mustard oil, and salt. Coat the stuffed potatoes with the marinade and let them rest for 30 minutes. Grill or bake the marinated potatoes until golden and slightly charred, ensuring even cooking by turning them occasionally. Finally, garnish the dish with coriander leaves and serve it hot with sliced onions and lemon wedges, perfect as a starter or accompaniment.</p>
