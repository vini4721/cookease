                    <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup pomegranate juice</li>

                <p class="ingredient"><strong>Recipe:</strong>To prepare Kandhari Paneer, start by marinating paneer cubes in a mixture of hung curd, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, mustard oil, and salt, and let it rest for 30 minutes. For the gravy, heat oil or ghee in a pan, splutter cumin seeds, and saut√© finely chopped onions until golden. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook briefly, then mix in tomato puree, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander powder, and garam masala, cooking until the oil separates. Stir in beetroot puree and pomegranate juice, simmer for a few minutes, and finish with fresh cream and salt to taste. Grill or pan-fry the marinated paneer cubes until golden and slightly charred, then add them to the prepared gravy, letting them simmer for a few minutes. Garnish with pomegranate arils and fresh coriander leaves, and serve hot with naan, roti, or jeera rice for a tangy, vibrant, and flavorful dish.</p>
