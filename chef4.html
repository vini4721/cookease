                <h2>Phool Surprise</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> </p>
                <ul class="ingredient">
                    <li>200g dark chocolate</li>
                    <li>1 balloon (inflated to a small size)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>200g cream cheese, softened</li>
                    <li>100g powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>100g fresh blueberries</li>
                    <li>200ml heavy cream</li>
                    
                    
                </ul>
                <p class="ingredient"><strong>Recipe:</strong>To create Chef Kunal Kapur's Phool Surprise, start by melting dark chocolate until smooth and glossy. Grease a small balloon with vegetable oil, dip it into the chocolate to coat evenly, and refrigerate it until the chocolate hardens. Once set, deflate the balloon carefully to reveal a delicate chocolate flower shell. For the cheesecake filling, blend fresh blueberries with sugar to make a puree. In a separate bowl, beat softened cream cheese with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until creamy, then fold in whipped cream for a light texture. Mix in the blueberry puree for a vibrant flavor. Assemble the dessert by spooning the cheesecake filling into the chocolate flower shell and garnish with fresh blueberries, mint leaves, and a drizzle of blueberry or chocolate sauce. Serve as a stunning, delicious dessert that blends artistry with taste.
