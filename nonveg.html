                        <h2>Tandoori Chicken</h2>

                         <p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Chicken (whole or drumsticks, skin removed), yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, smoked paprika (optional), kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), salt, mustard oil or vegetable oil, food color (optional, for red hue), fresh coriander leaves (for garnish).</p>
                         <p><strong>Recipe: </strong>Make deep cuts in the chicken to allow the marinade to penetrate. In a bowl, prepare the first marinade by mixing lemon juice, salt, and red chili powder. Rub this mixture all over the chicken and let it sit for 20 minutes.
                            For the second marinade, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, smoked paprika (if using), kasuri methi, mustard oil, and a pinch of food color (optional) in a large bowl. Coat the chicken pieces thoroughly with this mixture and let them marinate for at least 6-8 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.
                            Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) or prepare a grill. Place the marinated chicken on a baking tray or skewer and cook for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through. Brush with a little oil or butter during cooking for extra moisture. For an authentic smoky flavor, heat a piece of charcoal until red-hot, place it in a small bowl inside the tray, and drizzle a little oil over it to create smoke. Cover the tray for 5 minutes to infuse the smoky aroma.
                            Serve hot with lemon wedges, onion slices, and mint chutney. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves for a delicious tandoori chicken experience!</p>

                        <h2>Nihaari</h2>
                        <p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Mutton (shank pieces or bone-in meat), ghee or oil, onions (thinly sliced), ginger-garlic paste, whole spices (bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon stick, green cardamom), wheat flour (roasted, for thickening), water, salt, fresh ginger (julienned, for garnish), fresh coriander leaves (chopped), green chilies (sliced, for garnish), lemon wedges (for serving).

                            For the Nihari Spice Mix:
                            Red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, fennel seeds (ground), garam masala, nutmeg (ground), mace (ground), and black pepper (ground).
                            
                            </p>
                        <p><strong>Recipe: </strong>Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom, and sauté until fragrant. Add thinly sliced onions and cook until golden brown. Stir in ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute. Add the meat and cook on high heat until it is browned evenly.
                            Lower the heat and add the Nihari spice mix, stirring well to coat the meat. Pour in enough water to cover the meat completely, season with salt, and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 4-6 hours for tender meat and rich flavors.
                            In a small bowl, mix roasted wheat flour with water to make a smooth slurry. Gradually add this to the pot, stirring continuously, to thicken the gravy. Simmer for an additional 15-20 minutes until the gravy reaches a silky consistency.
                            Serve hot, garnished with fresh ginger, coriander leaves, green chilies, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Nihari pairs beautifully with naan, paratha, or steamed rice for a traditional and hearty meal.</p>
