                        <h2>Kashmiri Pulao</h2>

                        <p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Basmati rice, water, ghee or oil, whole spices (1-2 bay leaves, 4-5 cloves, 2-3 green cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick), onions (thinly sliced), ginger (julienned), garlic (minced), mixed dry fruits (cashews, almonds, raisins, pistachios), pomegranate seeds (optional), saffron strands (soaked in warm milk), cinnamon powder (optional), garam masala, salt, sugar, fresh coriander leaves (chopped), and fresh cream (optional).</p>
                        <p><strong>Recipe: </strong>Start by washing and soaking basmati rice for about 30 minutes, then drain the rice. In a large pot or pressure cooker, heat ghee or oil. Add whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon, and sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover the pan, and let it cook for 10-12 minutes until the rice is cooked through.
                            While the rice is cooking, in a separate pan, heat a little ghee and lightly fry the dry fruits (cashews, almonds, raisins, and pistachios) until golden and aromatic.
                            Once the rice is done, fluff it gently with a fork and stir in the fried dry fruits, saffron milk, pomegranate seeds (if using), and a pinch of cinnamon powder. Optionally, you can add a little cream for extra richness.
                            Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot. Enjoy your aromatic and flavorful Kashmiri Pulao with raita or a curry of your choice!</p>
